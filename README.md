# Electric Consumption Control -ACS712 Sensor
## Project Description
This project aims to **monitor the electric consumption** of household devices using the ACS712 sensor to identify usage patterns

## Specifications
- **Measuring Range:** 0 to 10A
- **Sensitivity:** +-0.1A
- **Desired Error:** Less than 5% in the range of 0.5A to 5A

## Tasks
[x] Conect the ACS712 sensor to measure the current of a household appliance (e.g., coffe maker or lamp).

[-] Record consumption during typical usage (e.g. on and off)

[-] Visualize consumption on a web page, displaying current graphs

## Requeriments
- **Hardware:**
  - Arduino Uno (or compatible)
  - ACS712 SENSOR (5A, 20A or 30A)
- **Software:**
  - Arduino IDE
  - Proteus Design Suite ^8.15
